# facebook-hackathon
Developed as part of Facebook Melbourne Hackathon 2019, this web app presents a simple idea, to provide fast and instant visual feedback to potential ideas through a simple web cam.

Users would be able to provide facial feedback to a webcam, which will be converted to Facebook Emojis.
